These PHP classes are part of a refactoring I did for an online learning platform’s live class routing system. The old code was hard to maintain and didn’t have any automated tests, which made changes risky since this was a core part of the business. The goal wasn’t just performance—although we did see about a 50% speed improvement—but to make the code more maintainable and easier to test without introducing new issues.
I applied the Strategy Design Pattern to split the routing logic into different strategies like FailoverRoutingStrategy, OverflowRoutingStrategy, PlatformTourRoutingStrategy, and RegularRoutingStrategy. This allowed us to write tests for each strategy separately and add new features, like the platform tour routing, without making the system harder to understand or work with. The new feature, in particular, would’ve added unnecessary complexity to the old code.

Before the refactoring, I was the only one who had deep knowledge of the old code, which made me the sole person responsible for maintaining it. This was risky for the business, as it was a critical system. During the refactoring process, the other developers were involved in every step—design, implementation, testing, and code reviews. By the time we finished, the knowledge of the routing system was shared across the team, giving the business peace of mind that the code was maintainable, secure, and no longer dependent on a single person.

It ended up with a more readable and maintainable codebase, with smaller, well-organized classes and short, focused methods. Adding automated tests was a key part of this, ensuring that future changes wouldn’t break things. The speed boost was a nice bonus, but the real win was simplifying the code so it’s easier for other developers to understand and build on, making the whole system much more resilient.
